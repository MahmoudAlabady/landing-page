# Landing Page Project
This is the first project for the Udacity Nanodegree in Front End Developer.
Starter code is included with the project. In the "app.js", you'll find the core project code. The index.html file and style are modified .
 
The goal of this project is to turn a static web page into a single interactive page.

When a segment is in the viewport, it shows the active status of that part using javascript to dynamically construct navbar links based on the content.

During scrolling, the navbar is automatically concealed and revealed in accordance with the scrolling direction.

A new element will display near the bottom of the page after scrolling past a customizable buffer. Users can use this element to scroll to the very top of the page.
